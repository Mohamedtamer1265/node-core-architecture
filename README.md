# Node.js Core Architecture

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base and "laboratory" for exploring the internal architecture of Node.js.

I am currently building this as I progress through the [Understanding Node.js: Core Concepts](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-nodejs-core-concepts/) course.

> **Status:** 🚧 Active Learning / Work in Progress

## 📚 Resources & Documentation

My learning is grounded in these primary resources:

* **Course:** [Understanding Node.js: Core Concepts (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-nodejs-core-concepts/) - *Highly recommended for deep system-level understanding.*
* **Official Documentation:** [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) - *The ultimate source of truth.*

## 🧠 Learning Goals

This repository is not just for code, but for understanding the "why" and "how" behind Node.js. My focus areas include:

* **The Node.js Runtime:** V8 Engine & Libuv.
* **Asynchronous Programming:** The Event Loop, Callbacks, and Promises.
* **System Integration:** Buffers, Streams, and File System (fs) operations.
* **Networking:** TCP/UDP, HTTP servers, and DNS.

## 🤝 Acknowledgments

A special thank you to **Joseph Heidari (Cododev)** for creating such an in-depth course. It has been instrumental in helping me move beyond the basics and understand what happens under the hood.
